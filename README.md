# CIS9665-Tablet-Reviews
This is my final group project for my CIS 9665 Applied NLP graduate course. My group and I analyzed Amazon Fire Tablet Reviews posted from 2010-2017 and built a model to predict whether a future review will recommend or not recommend the product based on top features of historical reviews.
